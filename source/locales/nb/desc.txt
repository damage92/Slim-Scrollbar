"Slim Scrollbar" : "Tynne rullefelt"

"A scrollbar with auto-hide" : "Rullefelt som skjules automatisk"

"Slim Scrollbar replace default scroll bars with two simple auto-hide bars. These bars are visible only when you scroll the page. So you obtain more space, useful especially for netbooks.

ATTENTION:
The extension can't automatically turn of the default scrollbars. To do it go in Preferences ▹ Advanced ▹ browsing, and deactivate "show scroll bars".

A well-know issue on oldest computers is performance loss during scrolling. You can try to activate "solve slow scrolling" options, but maybe the bars will flicker.

If you want to translate this extension you can email me or visit support page.
